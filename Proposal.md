# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

"Walk In The Night"

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A horror game where you walk in the street at night to go home, but you sense something eerie. You then see a poster for a murderer on the loose.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The point of the game is to add unexpected jump scares to hopefully scare people. The game will also show how it's dangerous to walk in the streets alone at night. The game will be made using Unity.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

None.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

None.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

- Jumpscares and sound effects
- Map of the streets
- Have houses and street lights surround the streets

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- Finding the right musics and sound effect to go with the jumpscares or just the little details

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- Hopefully the jumpscares are scary
- Making sure there are a lot of unexpected things
- Maybe adding a good story line along the way so it's not just a random jump scare

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

- Watch tutorials on how to make a simple horror game
- Learning how to use Unity along the way
- Finding good sound effects/ no copyrights
