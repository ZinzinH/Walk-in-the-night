# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Make a horror game in a first person view in a 3d world. Basically walking down the streets and you encounter some jump scares. Maybe adding in a stalker or a murderer.

Make a video game defeating some monsters and adding a leveling up system. 

Thinking of using unity for these ideas.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

None.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

None.
